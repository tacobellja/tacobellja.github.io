Here's a new OC I</h3><p>"It's been a while since I sat at a dinner table together with a family." The first question is whether 'a while' or 'awhile' is correct. 'Awhile' is the adverb and should never follow a preposition. For these reasons, I prefer 'awhile.' Second is the verb tense in the subordinate clause. To my ear, 'since I have sat' sounds odd.</p><img src ="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rdk99Sv-q34/maxresdefault.jpg" style="width:100%;text-align:center;" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://ts2.mm.bing.net/th?q=i-know-its-been-a-while-youtube.webp';"><br><h3>I Know Its Been A While...
