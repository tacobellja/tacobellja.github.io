After "Avatar 3", there are two.</p><img src ="https://preview.redd.it/6bs2hvupfbk91.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=2a455a68321ab5b6d3feef26c68c3c87db936c8e" style="width:100%;text-align:center;" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://ts2.mm.bing.net/th?q=avatar-neteyam-x-reader-portal-tutorials-riset.webp';"><br><h3>Avatar Neteyam X Reader Portal Tutorials Riset</h3><p>After the death of his older sibling, Neteyam, Lo'ak is now the big brother of the Sully clan.

He doesn't want to face the truth and guilt he feels, but then he does and a part of him heals through Neteyam's words.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QGWcC8dsKDk">
